#1
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Ports}}"

#2
docker logs -f devex4-jenkins-1 --tail 200

#3
docker exec devex4-jenkins-1 cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

TEST:


A. Unlock Jenkins & finish first-time setup (UI)
Open Jenkins in your browser: http://localhost:7777 (from your docker ps).
On the Unlock page paste the initial admin password you already have:

b786019665a24aaf9d3b46dce6529490

Click Continue → Install suggested plugins → wait until plugins finish installing.
When prompted, Create First Admin User:
Full name: e.g. admin
Username: admin
Password: your chosen secure password
Email: optional
Click Save and Finish.
Click Start using Jenkins to land on the dashboard.

B. Install the “HTML Publisher” plugin
UI method (easiest)
On Jenkins dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins.
Go to Available tab → search box type: HTML Publisher (or htmlpublisher).
Check the plugin → click Install without restart (or Download now and install after restart).
Wait until the install completes (you’ll see progress). If it says restart required, restart Jenkins (Manage Jenkins → Restart Safely).
CLI / Docker method (non-UI, faster)

If you prefer to install quickly from host shell:

docker exec -it devex4-jenkins-1 jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins htmlpublisher
# then restart Jenkins container (optional)
docker restart devex4-jenkins-1
(jenkins-plugin-cli is available in official Jenkins images. This installs htmlpublisher.)

C. Create the Freestyle job: simple-html-site
1 — Create job (UI)

Jenkins dashboard → New Item.
Enter simple-html-site as name.
Select Freestyle project → OK.

2 — Configure Build step

In job configuration → Build section → Add build step → Execute shell (this is available because Jenkins master container runs Linux).
Paste these commands into the shell text box exactly:
mkdir -p site
echo "<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><title>Simple HTML Site</title></head><body><h1>Welcome to Jenkins Static Site</h1></body></html>" > site/index.html


Notes:
mkdir -p site ensures the directory exists.
The file site/index.html will be created in the job’s workspace (e.g., /var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-html-site/site/index.html).

3 — Configure Post-build action (Publish HTML report)

In job config → Post-build Actions → Add post-build action → Publish HTML reports (this appears after installing HTML Publisher plugin).
Set these fields:
HTML directory to archive: site
Index page[s]: index.html
Report title: Simple HTML Site

(Optional) Check Keep past HTML reports if you want history.
Save the job.

D. Build the job and view the HTML report

On the job page (simple-html-site) click Build Now (left side).
Click the build number in Build History (e.g., #1) → wait for the build to finish.
On the left side of the build page you will see a link called Simple HTML Site (the report title). Click it and the static HTML page (Welcome to Jenkins Static Site) will render in your browser.
